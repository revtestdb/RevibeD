How can I assist you today?\n\n[Anonymous]: So my dad has bought a MacBook for me, and we thought it got stolen so I had locked it through find my. The problem is, it never got stolen in the first place — the maid misplaced it. Now I wanted to give it to my mother, but the thing is I got rid of the tie to my find my thinking it would get rid of the lock, however it’s still on this screen\n\n[AI Bot]: I understand how frustrating this situation must be. If your MacBook is still showing the lock screen from Find My, removing it from your account alone won’t unlock it. You’ll need to enter the passcode you set when you locked it through Find My. \n\nIf you don’t remember the passcode or can’t unlock it, you may need to contact Apple Support with proof of purchase for further assistance.\n\nWould you like some troubleshooting tips or guidance on what to do next?\n\n[Anonymous]: I was on call w apple support and they told me to find the MDM number \n\n[AI Bot]: If Apple Support asked you to find the MDM (Mobile Device Management) number, they likely want to check if the MacBook is managed by an organization or school. Usually, personal MacBooks do not have MDM profiles unless set up by a company or institution.\n\nTo check for MDM on your MacBook:\n\n1. On the lock screen, look for any message mentioning \"This Mac is managed\" or similar.\n2. If you can log in, go to  > System Settings > Profiles. If there’s an MDM profile, it will be listed there.\n\nIf you’re still locked out and can’t access the settings, you may need to provide Apple with the serial number (found on the MacBook’s underside or box) instead.\n\nWould you like more detailed steps or help with something else?\n\n[Anonymous]: its unfortunately LOCKED still \n\n[AI Bot]: I’m sorry you’re still locked out. If the MacBook is stuck on the lock screen and you can’t access the settings, you won’t be able to check for MDM directly. In this case, provide Apple Support with the MacBook’s serial number (found on the bottom of the device or on the box). They can use this to check the device’s status and guide you further.\n\nIf you need more help or have questions about your MacBook, let me know!\n\n[Anonymous]: How do\n\n[AI Bot]: It looks like your message got cut off. Could you please let me know what you’d like to ask or how I can assist you further?\n\n[Anonymous]: I find out the serial number \n\n[AI Bot]: You can find your MacBook’s serial number in these ways:\n\n- On the bottom of your MacBook (engraved in small print).\n- On the original box or purchase receipt.\n\nLet me know if you need more help!\n\n[Support Agent]: (No text content)\n\n[Anonymous]: The purchase receipt doesn’t say anything \n\n[AI Bot]: If the purchase receipt doesn’t show the serial number, please check the bottom of your MacBook. The serial number is usually engraved in small print near the regulatory markings. If you still have the original box, it should also be printed on a sticker there.\n\nIf you need more help, let me know!\n\n[Anonymous]: Can I call a real person from here\n\n[AI Bot]: If you need to talk to an agent, please send an email to contact@revibe.me or call us on +971 4 459 7000.\n\n[Anonymous]: I’m in saydi tho\n\n[AI Bot]: If you are in Saudi Arabia, you can still email contact@revibe.me for support, or you can use the UAE phone number: +971 4 459 7000.

I have invoice and and receipts but I need the number and the serial number, how do I get it is there anyway I can ask one of the employees to look into the database and give it to me\n\n[AI Bot]: I understand your situation and how frustrating it must be.
