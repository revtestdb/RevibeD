How can I assist you today?\n\n[Anonymous]: So my dad has bought a MacBook for me, and we thought it got stolen so I had locked it through find my.

Now I wanted to give it to my mother, but the thing is I got rid of the tie to my find my thinking it would get rid of the lock, however it’s still on this screen\n\n[AI Bot]: I understand how frustrating this situation must be. If your MacBook is still showing the lock screen from Find My, removing it from your account alone won’t unlock it. You’ll need to enter the passcode you set when you locked it through Find My. \n\nIf you don’t remember the passcode or can’t unlock it, you may need to contact Apple Support with proof of purchase for further assistance.\n\nWould you like some troubleshooting tips or guidance on what to do next?\n\n[Anonymous]: I was on call w apple support and they told me to find the MDM number \n\n[AI Bot]: If Apple Support asked you to find the MDM (Mobile Device Management) number, they likely want to check if the MacBook is managed by an organization or school. Usually, personal MacBooks do not have MDM profiles unless set up by a company or institution.\n\nTo check for MDM on your MacBook:\n\n1. On the lock screen, look for any message mentioning \"This Mac is managed\" or similar.\n2. If you can log in, go to  > System Settings > Profiles. If there’s an MDM profile, it will be listed there.\n\nIf you’re still locked out and can’t access the settings, you may need to provide Apple with the serial number (found on the MacBook’s underside or box) instead.\n\nWould you like more detailed steps or help with something else?\n\n[Anonymous]: its unfortunately LOCKED still \n\n[AI Bot]: I’m sorry you’re still locked out.
